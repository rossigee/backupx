Backup scripts
==============

This `backup` program, given a backup configuration, will cycle through a list of backup 'sources', packing them up and encrypting them into a temporary file, which it will upload to each of a list of destinations, finally reporting success or failure via a list of notification handlers.

This is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the python-based [`backups`](https://github.com/rossigee/backups) scripts I have been using for the last few years. The main functional difference will be that it will stream the backups directly to the destination without first creating a temporary file.


Overview
--------

Roughly speaking there are 'sources', 'destinations' and 'notifications'.

Currently implemented sources are:

* folders (using tar)
* folders via SSH (using tar)
* MySQL databases (using mysqldump)
* MySQL databases via SSH (using mysqldump)
* RDS database snapshots (using mysqldump)
* PostgreSQL databases (using pg_dump)
* Azure Managed Disks

Currently implemented destinations are:

* an S3 bucket (uses aws-cli)
* a GS bucket (uses gsutil)
* a Samba share (uses pysmbc)

Currently implemented notifications are:

* an e-mail (via smtplib)
* a HipChat room notification
* a Discord room notification
* a Slack notification
* a Telegram notification
* a simple flag file
* a Prometheus push gateway
* an Elasticsearch index

Hopefully, it's fairly straightforward to extend or add to the above.

The sources will be used to generate dump files in a temporary working area. By default, this is '/var/tmp', but for large DB dumps, you may need to specify an alternative folder mounted somewhere with enough space to store a compressed dump, and it's encrypted equivalent, temporarily.

Backups will be encrypted with a given passphrase (using GnuPG), and put into a folder on the destination using the following filename pattern...

    /{hostname}/{yyyy-mm-dd}/{dumpfile_id}.{sql|tar}.gpg

If the backup configuration specifies a retention policy, then any copies that exist on the backup destination that fall outside that scope are deleted. Typically, a retention policy will specify to keep a copies for a certain number of days, or just a number of the most recent copies.

If encryption is not needed or desired, you may specify that only compression is used. Note that this will not safeguard the contents of the file should someone gain access to it. Compression is performed using gzip --fast and can be specfied in the source configuration using...

    "compress_only": 1

Also, a word to the wise about scheduling. Backing up large chunks of data can use a lot of resources, and even if set to run after 'work' hours, can often run for on into the morning and indeed the next working day. Break larger backups down into smaller chunks where possible. If you are backing up mission criticial servers over mission critical network connections, you may need to take additional precautions to ensure that your backup scripts are not going to cause knock-on problems. You have been warned.

For security purposes, the script is designed to run as a non-privileged user. By default, it expects to be run as the 'backups' user, but this can be overridden using the 'RUN_AS_USER' environment variable.


Installation
------------

1. Install me. Unpack me, run 'python setup.py' as root.

1. Create a configuration file listing the folders/databases you want to back up, an encryption passphrase, and one or more places you want the encrypted dump file uploaded to, and details of any notification methods you wish to use. See docs further down for examples. You can install the dependencies now, or you can wait until you get errors later :)

1. Create a 'backups' user to run the script as. If you need folders to be backed up that require superuser privileges, you will also need a 'sudoers' directive to allow the backups user to run 'tar' as root to do it's work.

```
# cat >/etc/sudoers.d/99-backups <<EOF
backups ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/tar
EOF
```

1. Test your configuration by doing an initial run of the backup.

``` bash
# sudo -H -u backups /usr/local/bin/backup -v /home/backups/mynightlybackup.cfg
```

1. Add your job to cron.

```
# cat >/etc/cron.d/nightly-backups.conf <<EOF
0 2 * * * backups /usr/local/bin/backup /home/backups/mynightlybackup.cfg
EOF
```

You're done.


Example configuration
---------------------

IMPORTANT: The configuration file may contain sensitive information. Be sure to keep it somewhere safe, with suitable permissions.

To keep things simple, backup jobs are defined as JSON files, and are passed in at runtime.

The root object will contain the default settings that are not specific to a particular source, destination or notification.

```json
{
  "hostname": "my.hostname.com",
  "tmpdir": "/var/tmp/backups",
  "modules": [],
  "sources": [],
  "destinations": [],
  "notifications": [],
}
```

Parameters available in the root object:

| Config key | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| hostname | Used to help identify the folder the backup should be stored in on the destination. |
| tmpdir | Somewhere with enough temporary space to contain the compressed backup and it's encrypted copy as it's being built. |
| modules | A list of modules to load to handle this job. |
| sources | A list of sources to collect backup data from. |
| destinations | A list of destinations to push backup data to. |
| notifications | A list of mechanisms by which to report success/failure. |


Source - Folder
---------------

You can specify one or more folders to be backed up.

The 'modules' paramter must contain the `backups.sources.folder` module and there should be one or more source objects such as:

```json
{
  "id": "accountsdata",
  "name": "Live Accounts Data",
  "type": "folder",
  "path": "/var/lib/myaccountspkg/data"
}
```

You can specify an array of `--exclude` parameters to tell tar which folders/files to exclude too.

```json
{
  "id": "accountsdata",
  "name": "Live Accounts Data",
  "type": "folder",
  "path": "/var/lib/myaccountspkg/data",
  "excludes": [
    "tmp",
    "*~"
  ]
}
```

Parameters available in 'folder':

| Config key |  Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| name |  Description of data being backed up (for reporting purposes). |
| path | Name of file or folder to be backed up. |
| passphrase | A passphrase to encrypt the backup with (using GnuPG). |
| excludes | One or more files/paths to be excluded from the backup. |


Source - MySQL Database
-----------------------

You can specify one or more mySQL databases to be backed up.

The 'modules' paramter must contain the `backups.sources.mysql` module and there should be one or more source objects such as:

```json
{
  "id": "livecompanydb",
  "name": "Live Company Data",
  "type": "mysql",
  "dbhost": "localhost",
  "dbname": "livecompany",
  "dbuser": "backups",
  "dbpass": "zzzuserwithreadonlyperms",
  "passphrase": "64b0c7405f2d8051e2b9f02aa4898acc",
  "compress_only": 1
}
```

The script creates a temporary 'mysqlclient' credentials file using the given details, and passes it as the '--defaults-file' argument.

By default, the '--events' flag is passed to mysqldump. This may break older versions of mysqldump (prior to version 5.1, IIRC), so you can disable this flag with the 'noevents' parameter. I hope you aren't using versions of MySQL that old!

```
[client]
host=specific.host.database.com
...
noevents=1
```

If supplied, directives should be a single string with all options seperated with a space.
For example:

```json
{
  "options": "--all-databases --single-transaction --skip-triggers"
}
```

NOTE: If you pass --all-databases as a directive, dbname will be ignored.

Parameters available in 'mysql':

| Config key | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| name | Description of data being backed up (for reporting purposes). |
| dbhost | Name of the mySQL host to connect to. |
| dbname | Name of the mySQL database to back up. You may specify more than one. |
| dbuser | Username to connect to mySQL as. |
| dbpass | Password to connect to mySQL with. |
| defaults | The location of an 'mysqlclient' credentials file to use instead of creating a temporary one with using above 'db*' variables. |
| options | An optional string of options to pass to 'mysqldump'. |
| noevents | Don't pass the '--events' flag to 'mysqldump'. |


Source - PostgreSQL Database
----------------------------

You can specify one of more PostgreSQL databases to be backed up.

```json
{
  "id": "livecompanydb",
  "name": "Live Company Data",
  "type": "pgsql",
  "dbhost": "localhost",
  "dbname": "livecompany",
  "dbuser": "backups",
  "dbpass": "zzzuserwithreadonlyperms",
  "passphrase": "64b0c7405f2d8051e2b9f02aa4898acc"
}
```

The script creates a temporary 'pgpass' credentials file using the given details.

Parameters available in 'pgsql':

| Config key | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| name | Description of data being backed up (for reporting purposes). |
| dbhost | Name of the PostgreSQL host to connect to. |
| dbname | Name of the PostgreSQL database to back up. |
| dbuser | Username to connect to PostgreSQL as. |
| dbpass | Password to connect to PostgreSQL with. |


Source - RDS Database Snapshots
-----------------------

You can specify one or more Amazon RDS databases to be backed up, where they have automated rolling backups enabled. Currently, this only supports MySQL-based RDS instances.

The last automatic snapshot of the given database will be identified using the AWS credentials provided. That will then be restored to a temporary instance, in a security group that allows access to the agent machine. The agent machine (running this script), will then 'mysqldump' the data to a '.sql.gz' file, and destroy the temporary instance. This avoids the need to run any backup queries that would adversely affect the performance of the live database.

WARNING: This can take a very long time in many cases.

```json
{
  "id": "livecompanydb",
  "name": "Live Company Data",
  "type": "pgsql",
  "dbhost": "localhost",
  "dbname": "livecompany",
  "dbuser": "backups",
  "dbpass": "zzzuserwithreadonlyperms",
  "instancename": "livedb1",
  "region": "eu-west-1",
  "security_group": "livedbbackup",
  "instance_class": "db.m1.small",
  "passphrase": "64b0c7405f2d8051e2b9f02aa4898acc"
}
```

This module uses the 'boto' package, and expects auth credentials to be provided in the '~/.boto' file. This needs to be configured:

```
# cat >/home/backups/.boto <<EOF
[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = YOURACCESSKEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOURSECRETKEY
EOF
# chown backups /home/backups/.boto
# chmod 400 /home/backups/.boto
```

By default, the '--events' flag is passed to mysqldump. This may break older versions of mysqldump (prior to version 5.1, IIRC), so you can disable this flag with the 'noevents' parameter.

The 'security_group' must allow access from the host running mysqldump.

Parameters available in 'rds':

| Config key | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| name | Description of data being backed up (for reporting purposes). |
| dbhost | Name of the mySQL host to connect to. |
| dbname | Name of the mySQL database to back up. |
| dbuser | Username to connect to mySQL as. |
| dbpass | Password to connect to mySQL with. |
| defaults | The location of an 'mysqlclient' credentials file to use instead of creating a temporary one with using above 'db*' variables. |
| noevents | Don't pass the '--events' flag to 'mysqldump'. |
| aws_access_key_id | AWS access key |
| aws_secret_access_key | AWS secret access key |
| instancename | RDS instance name to clone backup of. |
| region | AWS hosting region of RDS database. |
| security_group | VPC security group for replica to provide access to. |
| instance_class | RDS instance class to create replica as (defaults to 'db.m1.small'). |


Source - Volume snapshots
-------------------------

This method allows us to specify a set of RDS/EC2 volumes. When sourced, this will issue snapshot commands for the volumes or instances specified.

```json
{
  "id": "livecompanydb",
  "name": "Live Company Data",
  "type": "snapshot",
  "instancename": "maindb1",
  "credentials": {
    "aws_access_key_id": "AKIAJPG7RJVVKWT3UX3A",
    "aws_secret_access_key": "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"
  }
}
```

It leaves a temporary file with status details as a 'dumpfile'. This gives the destination plugin something to work with when reporting success.

This source plugin is best used in a configuration on it's own, or with other volume snapshot definitions only, as used with a destination but no payload the configuration wouldn't make much sense!

NOTE: This plugin is largely unused and unmaintained at present.


Parameters available in 'snapshot':

| Config key | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| name | Description of data being backed up (for reporting purposes). |
| volume_id | ID of the EBS volume to be snapshotted. |
| availability_zone | AWS availability zone. |
| aws_access_key_id | AWS access key. |
| aws_secret_access_key | AWS secret access key. |


Source - Azure Managed Disks
----------------------------

This method uses the Azure API to create a snapshot of the specified managed disk.

```json
{
  "id": "mydisk1",
  "type": "azure-managed-disk",
  "name": "My Disk 1",
  "subscription_id": "285adaab-abcd-41cc-1234-9f256543d534",
  "source_resource_group": "MC_KUBERNETES_AZURECLUSTER1_NORTHEUROPE",
  "destination_resource_group": "MyBackupsResourceGroup",
  "disk_name": "mydisk1",
  "retain_snapshots": 3
}
```

The `retain_snapshots` ensures that a certain number of recent snapshots are left on Azure.

Parameters available in 'azure-managed-disk':

| Config key | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| subscription_id | The Azure subscription ID |
| source_resource_group | The RG that the managed disk resides in |
| destination_resource_group | The RG that the snapshot should be created in |
| disk_name | The name of the managed disk in the source RG |
| retain_snapshots | How many snapshots to leave in place on Azure |

Additionally, the following environment variables must be defined for authentication (from AD service principal):

| Env var | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| TENANT_ID | Azure Tenant ID |
| CLIENT_ID | Azure client/app ID |
| CLIENT_KEY | Azure client secret key |


Source - LVM over SSH
---------------------

This method calls LVM commands over SSH to obtain a snapshot of an LVM volume.

```json
{
  "id": "mydisk1",
  "type": "lvm-ssh",
  "name": "My Disk 1",
  "sshhost": "hostname.domain.com",
  "sshuser": "root",
  "vg_name": "ubuntu-vg",
  "lv_name": "mydisk1",
  "size": "5G",
  "retain_snapshots": 3
}
```

The `retain_snapshots` ensures that a certain number of snapshot volumes are retained on the host.

Parameters available in 'lvm-ssh':

| Config key | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| sshhost | The hostname to SSH to |
| sshuser | The username to SSH with |
| vg_name | The volume group name |
| lv_name | The logical volume name |
| size | The logical volume size |
| retain_snapshots | How many snapshot volumes to leave in place |


Destination - S3
----------------

You can specify an S3 bucket to back up to.

```json
{
  "bucket": "backups-123456789",
}
```

The 'aws' CLI client gets it's authentication credentials and other configuration from the 'backups' user's '~/.aws/config' file. This needs to be configured as per instructions in the AWS CLI documentation.

Additionally, the S3 destination provides some simple backup rotation options. After a successful backup, the backup files are listed and the 'retention_copies' and 'retention_days' options, if present, are applied to identify and remove any backups that are no longer required.

Parameters available in 's3':

| Config key | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| bucket | S3 bucket to dump files to. |
| region | AWS availability zone. |
| aws_access_key_id | AWS access key. |
| aws_secret_access_key | AWS secret access key. |
| retention_copies | How many copies of older backups to keep. |
| retention_days |  How many days of backups to keep. |
| endpoint_url | (optional) Endpoint URL for S3 service |


Destination - GS
----------------

You can specify a GS bucket to back up to.

```json
{
  "bucket": "backups-123456789",
}
```

The 'gs' destination module uses the boto library in conjunction with 'gsutil.' The 'gsutil' CLI client gets it's authentication credentials and other configuration from the 'backups' user's '~/.boto' file.

The GS module requires a GCP service account to be created with appropriate permissions to write and delete from GS buckets. The key file needs to be in P12 format. IMPORTANT: Properly secure this file and related information.

More information on configuring gsutil and boto as well as preparing a service account can be found at https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/boto-plugin.

The boto file should contain entries similar to:
```
[Credentials]
gs_service_client_id = some-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
gs_service_key_file = /some/path/to/your/service-account-credential-file.p12
gs_service_key_file_password = asecretpassword

[GSUtil]
default_api_version = 2
```
AWS and GCP credential data can happily share the same section.

Additionally, the GS destination provides some simple backup rotation options. After a successful backup, the backup files are listed and the 'retention_copies' and 'retention_days' options, if present, are applied to identify and remove any backups that are no longer required.

Parameters available in 'gs':

| Config key | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| bucket | GS bucket to dump files to. |
| gs_service_client_id | GCP service account. |
| gs_service_key_file | Location of service account file (in P12 format). |
| gs_service_key_file_password | Password for service account file. |
| retention_copies | How many copies of older backups to keep. |
| retention_days |  How many days of backups to keep. |

  "flagfile": "/backups/gitdata.ok"
}
```

We use this on our backup agents in conjunction with a simple 'file_age_secs' script running via SNMP. The following line in the 'snmpd.conf' file allows us to poll how long ago the last known successful backup was run.

```
exec check_git_backups /usr/local/bin/file_age_secs /backups/gitdata.ok
```

We then configure our monitoring/alerting service, Icinga, to poll this value and alert is if it exceeds a certain time.

(for file_age_secs source see https://gist.github.com/rossigee/44b9287e95068ebb9ae1)

Parameters available in 'flagfile':
